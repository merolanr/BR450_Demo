This code can be loaded onto the EFR32 dev board in order to transmit voltages associated with a force sensitive resistor voltage divider circuit. The LMP91000 header file contains several functions used to interface with the lmp91000 potentiostat IC, implementations within the app.c file can be found; however they have been commented out as they are untested.
